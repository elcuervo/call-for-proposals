# The Future is Dead: Long live the Past

We keep looking for good ideas to improve our code, to make our systems even
more powerful. But there are a lot of good ol' ideas that we are discovering but
most of them were already thought about years ago.

I propose a journey through technology archeology to re-discover all that tools
that are burien deep into the internetz.

Remember the scriptures of 'The unix way', the HTTP reference engraved in stone
and learn from the elders about concurrency and single responsability.
